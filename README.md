# install-whisky-steam-games-2025

if you have a problem with the game loading stuck, then I have found a solution (solved in the whiskey discord)

You can solve this problem by downloading the game on a regular steam for mac and then copying the folder with the game to whiskey steam

Algo:
1) open steam on your mac, then enter "steam://open/console/" in safari  

2) in the steam console, enter:
```@sSteamCmdForcePlatformType windows```

3) then enter the command to download the game (the id can be found on steamdb): 
```app_install <game id>```

4) then copy the folder with the game on your mac steam

5) insert this folder into whiskey steam

6) start installing the game on Whiskey Steam, instead of installing it, it will check the files and the game can be successfully launched
